          ReactJS is component driven. Everything is a component which is
          responsible for some functionality. You write small, small components
          and then combine them together to form big components. This makes the
          code more readable and understandable. The features that make React
          powerful and beautiful are:
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          It uses the virtual DOM concept instead of the real DOM.
          
            Code readability because of JSX. The use of JSX makes you feel like
            you're writing web apps (gives a look to JavaScript like HTML).
          
          It also uses SSR (SSR helps in SEO).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          These are the things which you might have read about but you will get
          to understand and feel when you go through this tutorial. So, let's
          dive into the concept of the virtual DOM (I would say this is the main
          feature which makes React more beautiful).

          ReactJS Virtual DOM The virtual DOM is a copy of the real DOM. Unlike
          the real DOM, the virtual DOM does the minimum amount of DOM
          manipulation to keep components up-to-date. It only updates the part
          which has been updated.
